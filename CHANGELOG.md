## 0.5.1

- Fixed [#9](https://github.com/cj0x39e/flutter_confetti/issues/9)

## 0.5.0

- add the `enableCustomScheduler` argument to `Confetti`. If true, the confetti will use a timer to schedule the confetti, it is useful when you want to keep the speed of the confetti constant on every device with different refresh rates.

## 0.4.0

- Fix y position for particles.
- Add the `insertInOverlay` argument to the `Confetti.launch` function. This will be useful when you need to add the confetti OverlayEntry to a custom overlay.
